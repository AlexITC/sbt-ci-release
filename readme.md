# sbt-ci-release

This is an sbt plugin to help automate publishing from Travis CI to Sonatype.

- tag pushes are published to Maven Central
- merge into master commits are published as -SNAPSHOT

Beware that publishing from Travis CI requires you to expose Sonatype
credentials as secret environment variables in Travis CI jobs. However, note
that secret environment variables are not accessible during pull requests.

Let's get started!

First, follow the instructions in
https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html to create a Sonatype account
and make sure you have publishing rights for a domain name.

Next, install this plugin in `project/plugins.sbt`

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.geirsson" % "sbt-ci-release" % "1.0.0-M1")
```

By installing `sbt-ci-release` the following sbt plugins are also brought in:

- [sbt-dynver](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver): sets the version number
  based on your git history
- [sbt-pgp](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-pgp): to cryptographically sign the
  artifacts before publishing
- [sbt-sonatype](https://github.com/xerial/sbt-sonatype): to publish artifacts
  to Sonatype
- [sbt-git](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-git): to automatically populate `scmInfo`

Next, define publishing settings at the top of `build.sbt`

```scala
inThisBuild(List(
  organization := "com.geirsson",
  homepage := Some(url("https://github.com/scalameta/sbt-scalafmt")),
  licenses := Seq("Apache-2.0" -> url("http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0")),
  developers := List(
    Developer(
      "olafurpg",
      "Ólafur Páll Geirsson",
      "olafurpg@gmail.com",
      url("https://geirsson.com")
    )
  )
))
```

Next, create a fresh gpg key that you will share with Travis CI and only use for
this particular project.

```
gpg --gen-key
```

- For real name, use "$PROJECT_NAME bot". For example, in Scalafmt I use
  "Scalafmt bot"
- For email, use your own email address
- For passphrase, generate a random password with a password manager

At the end you'll see output like this

```
pub   rsa2048 2018-06-10 [SC] [expires: 2020-06-09]
      $LONG_ID
uid                      $PROJECT_NAME bot <a@a.is>
```

Take note of the id `$LONG_ID`, make sure to replace this ID from the code
examples below. The ID will look something like
`6E8ED79B03AD527F1B281169D28FC818985732D9`.

Next, copy the public gpg signature

```
# macOS
gpg --armor --export $LONG_ID | pbcopy
# linux
gpg --armor --export $LONG_ID | xclip
```

and post the signature to a keyserver: https://pgp.mit.edu/

Next, open the "Settings" panel for your project on Travis CI, for example
https://travis-ci.org/scalameta/sbt-scalafmt/settings.

Define four secret variables

- `PGP_PASSPHRASE`: The randomly generated password you used to create a fresh
- `PGP_SECRET`: The base64 encoded secret of your private key that you can
  export from the command line like here below

```
# macOS
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $LONG_ID | base64 | pbcopy
# linux
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $LONG_ID | base64 | xclip
```

- `SONATYPE_PASSWORD`: The password you use to log into
  https://oss.sonatype.org/
- `SONATYPE_USERNAME`: The email you use to log into https://oss.sonatype.org/
  gpg key.

Next, update `.travis.yml` to trigger `ci-release` on successful merge into
master and on tag push. We use
[Travis "build stages"](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-stages/) to
implement this. It's not necessary to use build stages. The reason we use build
stages is to prevent that `ci-release` runs multiple times in parallel jobs.

- define `test` and `release` build stages

```yml
stages:
  - name: test
  - name: release
    if: (branch = master AND type = push) OR (tag IS present)
```

- define your build matrix with `ci-release` at the bottom, for example:

```yml
jobs:
  include:
    # default stage is "test"
    - env: TEST="compile"
      script: sbt compile
    - env: TEST="formatting"
      script: ./bin/scalafmt --test
    # run ci-release only if all previous stages passed.
    - stage: release
      script: sbt ci-release
```

If we don't use Travis build stages but for example `after_success` instead, we
would run `ci-release` after both `TEST="formatting"` and `TEST="compile"`. As
long as you make sure you don't publish the same module multiple times, you can
use any Travis configuration you like.

We're all set! Time to manually try out the new setup

- Merge a PR to your project and watch the CI release a -SNAPSHOT for your
  project.
- Push a tag and watch the CI do a regular release for your project.

It's is normal that something fails on the first attempt to publish from CI.
Even if it takes 10 attempts to get it right, it's still worth it because it's
so nice to have automatic CI releases.
